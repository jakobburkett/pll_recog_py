# pll_recog_py
2-Sided PLL recognition tool (full color neutral optional)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer (I wanted to try patten matching after learning OCaml)
- Tkinter

## Usage
- Select Cross color on the left (default is white only)
- On the right side, "Next" generates a new case
- Typing cases into the text box at the bottom and pressing Enter or clicking the Enter button will check the case
    - Console messages indicate correct/incorrect
    - Cases with a, b, c, d (like gc, ua, aa, etc.) must have that indicated

## Future Work
- Fix the appearance
- Correct/incorrect indication in GUI
- Recommendations for memorization when incorrect (T vs R having 4 colors vs 3 checker, and other helpful learning tips)
